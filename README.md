## General Information
> Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
> The purpose of this project is to build a custom CNN model in tensorflow perform the following

> 1.With given initial size of the data set perform the following
   -  Find the training and validation accuracy aswell as the loss
   -  Check whether it underfits/overfits
   -  Check is there a class imbalance

> 2.Rebuild the model with manual data augmentaion and perform the following
   -  Find the training and validation accuracy aswell as the loss
   -  Check whether it underfits/overfits
   -  Check is there a class imbalance
> 3.Rebuild the model with manual data augmentaion and perform the following
   -  Find the training and validation accuracy aswell as the loss
   -  Check whether it underfits/overfits
   -  Check is there a class imbalance
> 5. Perform data augmentation with augmentation library, train the model and observe the parameters in step 1 to 3
> 6. Write the final conclusion
